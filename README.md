# Dumpster Fire: Reflow Hotplate On A Budget
Reflow soldering doesnâ€™t need to be expensive. This modified electronics repair hotplate is driven by a microcontroller and supports programmable thermal profiles including preheat, soak, and reflow phases â€” all for around $150. This includes an OLED screen and rotary encoder.

### That was my mission statement, here's why I am doing it.
I ordered some PCBs and chose not to have them preassembled to reduce cost. Once I realized how small 0402 surface mount parts are I started looking at strategies for how to solder them. A friend mentioned pick and place machines, but while I didn't go that route it led me to reflow soldering and I have been down the rabbit hole ever since.

### Where am I at?
Currently, I have the hardware done. I'm working on a BOM, but there were a lot of hardware safety considerations to take into account when modifying the hotplate unit I purchased. The wiring was simple enough, but care was taken to isolate the 3.3v circuit from the 110v circuit. The heating elements were wired in parallel, and I broke them out to two seperate 4 post terminals to handle power distrubution. I am using a solid state relay (SSR) to handle the switching of the AC current, and this is all controlled by a pico that monitors temp and controls the logic of the reflow process using a simple Proportional, Integral, and Derivative (PID) algorithm.

Where I am at with the software is I am working to tune the PID to get to a point where I can perfect a reflow profile for a given solder paste. I've been able to follow my desired profile successfully, and now I am debugging and fine tuning. Once this is done I'll do a small live test to see how the actual reflow goes and examine the data. After that I'll be adding a menu to set the reflow profile for the run from the display as opposed to hardcoding it.

### 06/07/25 code update
Was doing some debugging that came up during a dry run for the small live test. This led to improved pid.py and main.py files. Softer landing when nearing the final temp target to account for thermal inertia for one, and set PID variables whose declarations are at to the top of main.py as well as adding a reflow_output_reduction variable in the same area to help with setting the total percentage output should be after reduction. Made sense so I don't have to hunt them down in the middle of main.py to change them.

### Eight time is the charm - Near the end of March, 2025
Ok, so I updated the hardcoded solder profile to use the lower temp profile for the soldering paste I am actually going to use, and... I was able to follow the profile from what I can see. Here's the curve:

And here is the data sheet for the paste I am going to use to solder my PCBs. It appears to be within spec! ðŸŽ‰

I will need to manage the active cooling to bring the temp down but this is very good news for me.
