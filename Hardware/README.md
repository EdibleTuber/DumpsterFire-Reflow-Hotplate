# Disclaimer
I am not a certified electrician in any way, shape, or form. I in no way advocate anybody doing this unless you know what you are getting into and understand the risks. Household AC current is dangerous and every precaution should be taken to prevent touching live wires, separating and grounding circuits, fire prevention, etc. Never work with exposed live wires, make sure the hotplate switch is off, and don't plug this thing into AC current while you are working on the internals. Being zapped by AC 110v isn't fun, and all that being said I still didn't follow my own advice and recieved a shock while working on this project. Have a fire prevention and response strategy worked out in advance so you can respond accordingly in the event a fire does break out.

Again, please don't do this unlesss you are going to take the time to learn more about the type of electricity you are dealing with (which you should be learning about to master the fundamentals), and the precautions that need to be taken to stay safe and healthy.

# The Hardware
All right. If you are still with me let's talk about the hardware.
