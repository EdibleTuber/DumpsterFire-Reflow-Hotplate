Reflow Soldering Hotplate aka “The Dumpster Fire” DIY Reflow Machine for SMD PCB Assembly

What It Is - 2 mins
	A low-cost reflow soldering hotplate built from an electronics repair heater, controlled by a Raspberry Pi Pico. Follows a proper reflow profile with preheat, soak, and reflow stages.

What It’s Made Of - 10 mins
	• Heating Element: 850W electronics repair hotplate
	• Raspberry Pi Pico: brains of the operation
	• Solid State Relay (SSR): switches AC power to heating elements
	• Thermocouple + MAX31855: accurate temperature sensing
	• OLED Display: shows current status & temperature
	• Rotary Encoder: used to start cycles or select profiles
	• AC to DC Converter: powers the Pico from wall AC
	• 10A Fuse: came with the hotplate — keeps it safe

How It’s Wired - 10 mins
	• AC Hot & Neutral go into: 		
    → AC/DC converter → Pico & logic (5V) 		
    → SSR → Heating element (switched line)
	• Pico controls SSR via GPIO
	• All DC components share a common ground
	• AC side and DC side are electrically isolated

How It Works - 5 mins
	• Reads temperature from thermocouple
	• Follows a time-based reflow curve:
		1 Preheat
		2 Soak
		3 Reflow
		4 Cooldown (not controlled by the microcontroller)
	• Turns the heater on/off via SSR to stay on target
		• OLED shows stage + temperature in real-time

Why Build It? - 5 mins
	• Needed to solder 0402 SMD components on 11 PCBs
	• Professional reflow ovens cost $300+
	• Built this for ~$150 — learned a ton
	• Goal: lower the barrier to SMD assembly for others
      
 Safety Notes - 5 mins
	• AC hot is switched, not neutral
	• All high-voltage wiring fused & isolated
	• No AC ground or neutral connected to DC side
